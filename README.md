## Extension Commands (Jacks!)

See [jacks](jacks.md) for a more comprehensive list of commands and features.

|Jack|Description|Command|
|---|---|:---|
|__Pipeline__|Remotely build/abort/update Jenkins pipeline scripts from an open `groovy` file, streaming syntax highlighted output to the output console.|`extension.jenkins-jack.pipeline`|
|__Script Console__|Remote execute on the Jenkins Script Console from an open `groovy` file, targeting one or more nodes. Results will appearing in the output console.|`extension.jenkins-jack.scriptConsole`|
|__Build__|Select a job to download logs to display on the output window or to delete from the remote Jenkins.|`extension.jenkins-jack.build`|
|__Job__|Select one or more jobs to disable, re-enable, or delete from the remote Jenkins.|`extension.jenkins-jack.job`|
|__Node__|Select one or more nodes to set offine, online, or disconnect from the remote Jenkins.|`extension.jenkins-jack.node`|

Individual jacks can be mapped to hot keys as user sees fit.

## Auto-completions (faux snippets)

From your remote Jenkins, Jenkins Jack will pull, parse, and provide Pipeline steps as auto-completions from the Pipeline step definitions (GDSL).

Any `groovy` file in the editor will have these completions. This feature can be enabled/disabled via __Settings__ by searching for __Jenkins Jack__.

## Configuration
Jenkins Jack works by hooking into the user's running Jenkins instance via the Jenkins Remote API. Before you can use the plugin, you must fill in the extension settings to point to a Jenkins host(s) in `settings.json`:

```json
"jenkins-jack.jenkins.connections": [
    {
        "name": "localhost",                            // "name" can be seen in the host selection command
        "uri": "http://localhost:8080",
        "username": "drapplesauce",


        "password": "217287g126721687162f76f387fdsy7",  // gen API token via <your-jenkins>/user/<user name>/configure
                                                        // E.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080/user/drapplesauce/configure

        "active": true                                  // Indicates the active jenkins host you're connected to.
                                                        // Also set via host selection command
    }
]
```

You can get to this via the Settings UI (`ctrl+,`) and searching for `Jenkins Jack Connections`.

## Support
Do you have a feature request or would like to report a bug? Super duper! Create an issue via github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/tabeyti/jenkins-jack/issues).

Currently, there are no hard guidelines defined for feature requests, bugs, or questions since I have no idea what I'm doing. These will become more defined as interest in the project increases or something something.
